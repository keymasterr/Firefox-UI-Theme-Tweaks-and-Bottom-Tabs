# Firefox UI: Theme Tweaks and Bottom Tabs

In MacOS there is a menu bar on top. So browser tabs should be positioned on the bottom of the screen to make it easier to aim them.

And I hate that circle around the Back button. So as full-width search panel on bottom.

Also the Dark color theme was changed to be less contrast.

**UPD:** If you are struggling from bold fonts (I believe it happens on MacOS Catalina), there is a rule in _userContent.css_ to fix inpropper font smoothing. Put that file next to _userChrome.css_.
