# Firefox UI: Bottom Tabs (for MacOS)

<img src="241209 - Firefox layout @2x.png" width="684">

In MacOS there is a menu bar on top. So browser tabs should be positioned on the bottom of the screen to make it easier to aim them.

**2021.06.14 UPD:**
Since Firefox UI became acceptable from v89, bottom tabs only are in here. No theme tweaks anymore.
